**Command:** `/cs:linkedin-plan [your 90-day goal]`

Three decisions in order. Out of order is why most LinkedIn efforts produce a feed of
unrelated observations and stop in week five.

## When to run

- "What should I post about?" / "How often should I post?"
- "Should I start a LinkedIn newsletter?"
- Before drafting anything — posts without pillars are noise

## What you get

1. **A validated positioning brief** — one of six real objectives, an audience specific
   enough to exclude someone, two to four pillars with shares summing to 100, and at least
   two exclusions.
2. **Observable 90-day criteria.** Follower count is deliberately not among them.
3. **A weekly plan priced in minutes**, allocated by stage, plus the minimum viable week that
   survives a bad week.
4. **A newsletter verdict** — green, thin, or refused, with a 12-issue arc and a stop rule.

## Workflow

```bash
python3 ../skills/linkedin-strategy/scripts/positioning_brief.py --input brief.json --output human
#   exit 3 = objective or audience too vague to proceed. Fix that before anything else.

python3 ../skills/linkedin-strategy/scripts/cadence_planner.py \
  --minutes 240 --stage starting --target-posts 3 --output human
#   exit 2 = below the 90-minute floor -> comment-only week returned
#   exit 3 = over budget, with the overage named

python3 ../skills/linkedin-strategy/scripts/newsletter_planner.py \
  --followers 1800 --cadence biweekly --minutes-per-month 420 --output human
```

## Discipline

- **One objective.** Two serve neither; sequence instead of blending.
- **The exclusion list is the positioning.** Do not skip it because it feels negative.
- **Price the week from a bad week.** The plan has to survive week five, not week one.
- **From a standing start, most of the budget belongs in other people's comments.**
- **Review quarterly, not weekly.** A brief revised monthly is a mood.

## Stop conditions

- Brief at exit 0 and the cadence plan fits → done; hand over the minimum viable week.
- Cadence over budget twice on the same target → the target is the problem, not the plan.
  Say so and cut it.
- Newsletter refused → say why once, recommend posts on a fixed day instead, and stop.
